        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Tools</h1>
        <p>Throughout the duration of assignment 3, our group has used various tools which corresponds to the different areas of the project. GitHub was used to set up set up the website and Atom was used to modify it. A Trello board and a Gantt chart would also be created for organisational purposes. The way GitHub was used is similar to how it was used in the previous assignment. A single group member would modify the website, creating the required pages and placeholders for the other group members to insert their report content. The number of commits that a single user made to the repository usually would not dictate how much work they have completed. This is due to how each group member would write up the required content on a separate document and paste it to the website all at once. This would make it seem as though some members have done significantly less work due to the lower amounts of commits when, it would be equal. This is partial reason for the creation of the Trello board and the Gantt chart. These tools would allow our group to track the work that each member has done outside of the website which may include the report content, the development of the software and the development of the hardware. Using these tools allowed is to split the work amongst ourselves with ease and it also let us set deadlines for each task.

        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Group Processes</h1>

        <h2>Group Processes</h2>
        <p>Within the last assignment our group worked really well together with communication being a stand out. We all had frequent and consistent communication with each other on Teams, this included our meetings with a near flawless attendance record from all group members. In addition, the software Trello that we used was very useful and allowed to track everyone's progress throughout each stage but in the next assignment we will ensure itâ€™s getting updated consistently. Some of the things that we will change/implement in this assignment is ensuring we put deadlines on all tasks and consistently work on the report within Teams. This should ensure all the tasks are completed on time and we can manage are time efficiently. But overall most of the processes we had in out last assignment worked so we will continue use the software such as Trello but change the frequency of use also and be more proficient in using the live word document on teams.</p>
