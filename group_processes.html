        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Tools</h1>
        <p>Throughout the duration of assignment 3, our group has used various tools which corresponds to the different areas of the project. GitHub was used to set up set up the website and Atom was used to modify it. A Trello board and a Gantt chart would also be created for organisational purposes. The way GitHub was used is similar to how it was used in the previous assignment. A single group member would modify the website, creating the required pages and placeholders for the other group members to insert their report content. The number of commits that a single user made to the repository usually would not dictate how much work they have completed. This is due to how each group member would write up the required content on a separate document and paste it to the website all at once. This would make it seem as though some members have done significantly less work due to the lower amounts of commits when, it would be equal. This is partial reason for the creation of the Trello board and the Gantt chart. These tools would allow our group to track the work that each member has done outside of the website which may include the report content, the development of the software and the development of the hardware. Using these tools allowed is to split the work amongst ourselves with ease and it also let us set deadlines for each task.
