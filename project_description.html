        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Project Idea</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The project idea that our group unanimously decided on is a system that informs its users, through notifications, when there is an insufficient amount of water in an individual’s pet’s bowl (courtesy of Joaquin). This project will require developments in both, software, and hardware. The hardware portion of the project will include either the use of a raspberry pi or Arduinos in order to create a sensor that will monitor the level of water inside the pet’s bowl. The software portion of the project will consist of the app that needs to be developed which would send the user push notifications when the level of water inside the pet’s bowl is lacking. Our group has decided that we will split up and assign each member either the software or hardware side as some members of our group has little experience working with Arduinos or a raspberry pi. This would allow the members in our group who specialise in either software or hardware, respectively, to make full use of their skills. The development platform that the group has decided to use is Unity. Unity was chosen as some of the group members have prior experience using this platform which may assist us in progressing through the software development with fewer issues arising.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivational Factors</h2>
        <p>Motivation for the development of a system that monitors an individual’s pet’s water bowl comes from the fact that it may be useful to the owners of the 29 million pets across Australia. Out of these many owners, some may often forget to refill the water for their pets’ bowls. This may be due to illnesses, a person’s busy lifestyle or even just poor memory. If a pet, such as a dog, were to go for a few days without water, it can be very detrimental for them. By going three days without water, dogs will start to feel “very weak and lethargic”, indicating that they are in critical condition due to having no access moisture-rich foods or water. By having reminders, in the form of notifications, being sent to a pet owner’s phone, this will most likely reduce the likelihood of them forgetting to tend to their pets’ needs which would also make it less likely for pets to be dehydrated from factors that do not include illnesses. Another motivational factor for choosing this project is that some of our members were initially interested in working with the hardware, that being Arduinos and/or a raspberry pi, and so, choosing this project idea allows us to do so whilst also improving our software development skills.

        <h2>Description of the Product</h2>
        <p>The product begins with the sensor that is positioned in the pet’s bowl which would allow it to monitor the water levels. The sensor is able to detect the water levels inside the bowl by using a series of conductors in which their resistance correlates to the water level. If the sensor is submerged in more water, it will have less resistance and if the sensor is submerged in less water, the more resistance it will have. The user will be able to set the water level in which they are notified of unsatisfactory water level in the pet’s bowl. Once defined, the sensor will detect that the water level in the bowl has decreased, it will change from a green LED light to a red one. It will then send this data to the application on the user’s phone. This entire process is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller is able to detect when the sensor is no longer submerged and when it does, it will communicate this data to the user’s phone through Bluetooth. This message will be able to be sent as the Arduino that is used is a Bluetooth model and it will require the user’s phone to be connected to it through Bluetooth. The specific Bluetooth that will be used is Bluetooth Low Energy in order to reduce the amount of battery usage so that it can last longer. As soon as the message that there is an insufficient amount of water in the pet’s bowl has been received by the phone, data will be passed on to a custom application.
          <sup><a href="references.html">[49]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>The application will send a push notification to the user’s phone to alert them once the water in the bowl decreases below the set satisfactory level. The application will continue to send notifications to the user’s phone every 30 minutes until the bowl has been refilled or if the user disables the notifications through the app, manually. The notifications that will be displayed are push notifications which allows for them to be viewed outside of the app. This would let the user access information that is being sent through to the app without having the app opened. In addition to this, the application will also be able to collect data on when the water levels are low throughout each day and average the results. These results would allow the user to determine approximately when the water would need to be refilled each day. This feature is designed to be useful when the user is outside since Bluetooth is short ranged and will not be able to send data to the user’s phone about the bowl’s water levels whilst the user is far away from the bowl.
          <sup><a href="references.html">[50]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>The Arduino and the sensor will be kept within secure 3D printed, plastic housing. This ensures that the user’s pets will be unable to gain physical access to the Arduino and the sensor. Doing so greatly reduces the likelihood of the hardware being damaged or the pets accidently harming themselves. The wires that will be connecting the sensor to the Arduino will also be covered in waterproof wire tubing, preventing from becoming wet which would ultimately add an extra layer of protection for the hardware and the pets. Since the Arduino will be powered using a battery, it will not need to be plugged into an outlet, which would make it safer for pets as unnecessary wires may be a safety hazard to them and others. Doing so would also allow the bowl to be moved easier to different areas of the house.

        <h2>Tools and Technology Required</h2>
        <p>The tools and technology required to develop this product includes both physical appliances and the use of an application development software. The hardware of this project will include a water level sensor and an Arduino. The water level sensor would need to contain exposed copper traces which would be bridged when water is covering them. This allows for the water height to be tracked via resistance. The Arduino would need to be a HC-05 Bluetooth model in order for to add Bluetooth functionality to the system. This allows the data from the Arduino to be sent directly to the user’s smartphone through Bluetooth. An Arduino UNO will also be needed. The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller that is used to collect data using a variety of input options which then allows it to output the data. For the software side, Unity would be needed in order to create the application that would display the information sent from the Arduino. Unity would be used to create an Android application; if the app were to be ported over to iPhone, other software development tools such as Xcode would be needed.

        </p>

        <h2>Skills and Knowledge Required</h2>
        <p>The skills required to develop this product would include knowledge of programming languages in order to create the application that would be used to send push notifications to the user’s phone. Since we are planning on using Unity to create this application, members of our group would need an adequate understanding of the programming languages that can be used within Unity; these languages being C# or C++. Unity will be used to create both the logic and the UI for the application. This section of the project would be feasible since some of our group members have experience using Unity in the past which would allow them to progress with little to no issues relating to the development of the app. The skills required for the hardware section of the project includes basic knowledge on Arduinos and how electronic circuits connect them to other hardware appliances such as the sensor and the battery. This part of the project would also be feasible since Arduinos are fairly inexpensive compared to other hardware appliances. There are also many guides online that may allow us to have a better understanding of how Arduinos work and how to use them properly. This, ultimately, minimises the time that it would take to learn how Arduinos and other hardware appliances work. Other skills that may be needed is knowledge involving Swift, which is a programming language. This additional programming language may be needed if our group decides to port the application over to iPhone.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
        <p>If this project proved to be successful, it may reduce the overall amount of pet sicknesses caused by a lack of water. This is because it is consistently reminding those who tend to forget to refill their pets’ water bowls, through their phones, which they may have with them most of the time. As a result, this product will ensure that pets will remain appropriately hydrated given that their owners immediately take action when they are notified through the app that the water levels inside the pet’s bowl is low. The ideal function for this project will be: when the sensor detects that the water level inside a pet’s bowl is low, it will communicate this information to the application. A notification will then be sent to the owner’s phone, informing them that the bowl must be refilled.
