        <h2>Lachlan M:</h2>
        <p>I feel that just like our last assignment, overall the group worked very well together on this project. Communication via MS Teams was just excellent just as with our previous assignment, and though we had a few more absences during meetings, this was never a major problem as we always debriefed with the missing members afterwards, and overall attendance was still very good.
            <br><br>
            I think shifting around the roles from the last assignment the way we did was very effective. The distribution of work ended up being pretty equal too, and people were always happy to cover for others or volunteer for additional work whenever they weren’t too busy, which was fantastic to see.
            <br><br>
            The main thing that surprised me with this assignment was the issues we ran into with our hardware. Everything else was very smooth, but just configuring our Arduino ended up being much more difficult and complicated than I had believed it would be.
            <br><br>
            I also think this project proved to me the importance of dedicating time to pre-production, and the significant effect in can have. This was one of our major improvements over our previous assignment, as the more extensive planning meant we didn’t really have to crunch at all to get things done by the final submission milestone
            <br><br>
            I think we probably could have achieved more had we not taken a break at the start of the project and waited ~2 weeks to start the work proper, but we were still able to complete everything we set out to do (with the exception of the hardware due to unforeseen issues)
