        <h2>Lachlan M:</h2>
        <p>I feel that just like our last assignment, overall the group worked very well together on this project. Communication via MS Teams was just excellent just as with our previous assignment, and though we had a few more absences during meetings, this was never a major problem as we always debriefed with the missing members afterwards, and overall attendance was still very good.
            <br><br>
            I think shifting around the roles from the last assignment the way we did was very effective. The distribution of work ended up being pretty equal too, and people were always happy to cover for others or volunteer for additional work whenever they weren’t too busy, which was fantastic to see.
            <br><br>
            The main thing that surprised me with this assignment was the issues we ran into with our hardware. Everything else was very smooth, but just configuring our Arduino ended up being much more difficult and complicated than I had believed it would be.
            <br><br>
            I also think this project proved to me the importance of dedicating time to pre-production, and the significant effect in can have. This was one of our major improvements over our previous assignment, as the more extensive planning meant we didn’t really have to crunch at all to get things done by the final submission milestone
            <br><br>
            I think we probably could have achieved more had we not taken a break at the start of the project and waited ~2 weeks to start the work proper, but we were still able to complete everything we set out to do (with the exception of the hardware due to unforeseen issues)
            </p>

        <h2>Dominic G:</h2>
        <p>As with assignment 2 our group worked well together within assignment 3, with frequent meetings, everyone getting the work completed on time and consistent communication. Compared from last time it was good that we decided to add deadlines to each task which helped manage to not rush all the work on the day before it’s due. It enabled us as a group to manage and see when things should be done and overall helping with the management of all the tasks that had to be completed. In addition, it was good we implemented more meetings as it allowed us to ensure if anyone had issues and was able to get more frequent updates on the work.
     <br><br>


    Some of the main things we could have improved was to start a bit earlier especially with the hardware side it may have allowed more time to test and fix any difficult issues we had or giving us the ability to replace faulty parts. But overall, we were still able to get everything completed that was required.
     <br><br>


    As with assignment 2 our communication was once again surprising with everyone showing up to meetings, everyone communicating within team consistently, and even if any of the members did have to meet the meeting, they gave a brief run down on what they completed and what where their goals until the next meeting. In addition, the main thing I learned about working in a group was that communication is highly vital.
     <br><br>


    With the GitHub commits I don’t think it reflect the amount of work everyone has done, as only one person was primarily working on the website, thus other members including myself will only have commits from when they put in their work. </p>

        <h2>Kiet N:</h2>
        <p>Overall, the work ethic of the group was similar to that of assignment 2. The group worked very well with each other, and the communication was very consistent. We took a period of time off to recover from the previous assignment and finish off work from other subjects, which didn’t really affect us. Before we started the project, a Trello board was set up and due dates were assigned which was different from our last assignment as we did not have due dates then. This change helped our group consistently meet deadlines so that we did not have an overwhelming amount of work to catch up on nearing the end of the assignment period. Other organisational tools were used to help us become aware of all the tasks we had to complete which also helped.
          
        Something that could have been improved for this assignment is the purchasing of the hardware. Since we purchased it relatively late, we did not have enough time to determine that it was faulty and return it in order to swap it out for other bits of equipment.

        Some things that were surprising was how well the group worked despite having the roles swapped and how the hardware was not functioning properly. The roles being changed in our group did not affect the amount of work that everyone was doing; some members worked even better with their new roles. Also, the hardware not functioning was surprising since the hardware team has done extensive research on what the problems may be but in the end, it was still unable to be fixed.

        One thing I learnt about my group was that despite not being able to meet in person due to a certain accident, they were still able to work exceptionally well. This allowed us to progress through assignment 3 smoothly with little to no problems other than the hardware not working as intended.

        For the GitHub commits, since I was in charge of making changes to the website, the number of commits that I made would typically be significantly higher than the other members. The number of commits to the website, in our case, would not determine the amount of work that each member has done since most of the report content was written on another document and pasted onto the website and the software and hardware teams have little reason to make commits. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>All group members believe that the grouped worked well together and that we were able to complete the work on time to a high standard, like our last assignment. One of the main aspects our group believed we worked well was communication within Microsoft Teams, with many of us noting that the attendants was great but there was more than last time which many of us mentioned that it didn’t affect us greatly as the team member who misses the meeting gave a brief run down on everything they completed and their goals for the next meeting, and the level of communication was very consistent. In addition, another aspect that many of our team members believe we did well was adding due dates to each task which made it easier for management of all tasks that had to be completed.
 <br><br>


Some of the main improvements our team members noted was that we could have started earlier, with many noting it affected the hardware side as we purchased the components around three weeks from the due date. Which caused us from not having the ability to fix/return any faulty components that we purchased as noted earlier that we had limited time due to the break we took. However, many of the other members did note that the other work was still completed in a timely manner.
 <br><br>


Some of the things our group members found surprising was how well our group worked even with the changes in roles, with everyone still able to display a high degree of work in a timely manner. In addition, the main surprise for main surprise for many of our team members was the hardware components not working (possibly faulty) and configuration of the hardware was much more complicated as thought, especially as the hardware team followed the instructions to resolve the issues fully.
 <br><br>


The most common aspect our members have learned while working in a group was that we must be open with our deadlines and that communication about any issues we were facing was vital. As the group mentioned that it made it easier for work to be completed smoothly without too many issues except for the hardware side.
 <br><br>


In addition, the GitHub commits as a group we believe it didn’t reflect the work of our team as only one member was working on the website and the rest of the group was adding their work to the website. </p>
