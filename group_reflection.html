        <h2>Lachlan M:</h2>
        <p>I feel that just like our last assignment, overall the group worked very well together on this project. Communication via MS Teams was just excellent just as with our previous assignment, and though we had a few more absences during meetings, this was never a major problem as we always debriefed with the missing members afterwards, and overall attendance was still very good.
            <br><br>
            I think shifting around the roles from the last assignment the way we did was very effective. The distribution of work ended up being pretty equal too, and people were always happy to cover for others or volunteer for additional work whenever they weren’t too busy, which was fantastic to see.
            <br><br>
            The main thing that surprised me with this assignment was the issues we ran into with our hardware. Everything else was very smooth, but just configuring our Arduino ended up being much more difficult and complicated than I had believed it would be.
            <br><br>
            I also think this project proved to me the importance of dedicating time to pre-production, and the significant effect in can have. This was one of our major improvements over our previous assignment, as the more extensive planning meant we didn’t really have to crunch at all to get things done by the final submission milestone
            <br><br>
            I think we probably could have achieved more had we not taken a break at the start of the project and waited ~2 weeks to start the work proper, but we were still able to complete everything we set out to do (with the exception of the hardware due to unforeseen issues)
            </p>

        <h2>Dominic G:</h2>
        <p>As with assignment 2 our group worked well together within assignment 3, with frequent meetings, everyone getting the work completed on time and consistent communication. Compared from last time it was good that we decided to add deadlines to each task which helped manage to not rush all the work on the day before it’s due. It enabled us as a group to manage and see when things should be done and overall helping with the management of all the tasks that had to be completed. In addition, it was good we implemented more meetings as it allowed us to ensure if anyone had issues and was able to get more frequent updates on the work. 
     <br><br>


    Some of the main things we could have improved was to start a bit earlier especially with the hardware side it may have allowed more time to test and fix any difficult issues we had or giving us the ability to replace faulty parts. But overall, we were still able to get everything completed that was required. 
     <br><br>


    As with assignment 2 our communication was once again surprising with everyone showing up to meetings, everyone communicating within team consistently, and even if any of the members did have to meet the meeting, they gave a brief run down on what they completed and what where their goals until the next meeting. In addition, the main thing I learned about working in a group was that communication is highly vital.  
     <br><br>


    With the GitHub commits I don’t think it reflect the amount of work everyone has done, as only one person was primarily working on the website, thus other members including myself will only have commits from when they put in their work. </p>
