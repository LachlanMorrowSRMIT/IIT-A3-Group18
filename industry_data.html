        <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>After looking at information from different sources, none of our ideal jobs have changed, though it has provided us with valuable insight as to what skills and jobs are desired throughout the industry.</p>

        <h2>IT Specific Skills</h2>
        <p>IT-Specific Skills we would require includes good knowledge of a myriad of common programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#, other important IT-Specific skills that could be vital to our ideal jobs includes the ability to use SQL or SAP. Most, if not all these skills are expected from workers in the IT field. <br>
           Of these IT-Specific Skills, we lack the ability to use SQL to a great extent which can be vital to specific IT related jobs, we also lack knowledge of writing in JavaScript, whilst not as prominently as used anymore, JavaScript is still an important programming language that is expected to be known and may be relevant in many IT related jobs. C# is one of the most well-known programming languages, whilst more difficult than coding languages like Python, is in higher demand for Its’ faster running speed and similar widespread usage.
        <sup><a href="references.html">[6]</a></sup></p>

        <h2>General Skills</h2>
        <p>General Skills we would require includes good problem-solving skills, a strong level of communication skills, and the ability to adapt, for when the situation demands for it. Writing skills, which is how neatly we write our code which allows both the writer and others to more easily understand exactly what various parts of a code's purpose and function is. Other important general skill examples include creativity and troubleshooting, which is diagnosing and resolving code related problems.<br>
           Of these, general skills we lack includes creativity, specifically the ability to be able to view a problem from a different angle. Another general skill we could improve upon is the ability to adapt, which is vital as working in information technology, many jobs require high adaptability to different situations, and problem-solving, which is one of the most important skills in many IT related jobs, the ability to solve different problems that require different solutions can be the difference between beginner and advanced programmers.<sup><a href="references.html">[7]</a></sup> </p>

        <h2>IT Professional Interview<sup><a href="references.html">[8]</a></sup> </h2>
        <h3>Intro:</h3>
        <p> Daniel Paley is a high-level software, hardware and electrical engineer at Eloque which is based at PARC (Palo Alto Research Centre) in Silicon Valley, California, USA. Our group decided to choose him as our Interviewee as he is quite knowledgeable in micro computing/with small computers such as Raspberry Pi’s and Arduinos, and this relates to our project as we were planning on using one of them for our project (see Project Ideas for more details). We managed to get in contact with him as one of the members of the group has connections with Campbell Rose, the CEO of Eloque, who allowed us to get in contact with Daniel. The interview was conducted on the 6th of April 2022, and the people who were able to attend the interview was Max, Lachlan, Dominic and Kiet.

        <h4>Can you introduce yourself for us?</h4>
        <p>My name is Daniel Paley, and I am the Lead System Architect at Eloque. In my career that spans 30 odd years, I’ve done a lot of different things such as chip design, database application programming, embedded programing as well systems programming. When I was at school it was called Unix and not Linux, I’ve done an awful lot with that and would still rather have a Unix box than anything else. I worked at companies that did very high-end RF stuff, I wrote some of the world specs for RFID for the 100-megahertz worldwide RFID little key fobs. I am the only person in the in the world that worked on both the hardware and the software for the 900-megahertz stuff. I did almost all the verification of their Rambus membership singlehanded I had two other guys help but I did all the verification to make sure that that memory worked. I worked on the Nintendo 64, I did almost all of the verification of the RAM bus verification singlehanded, I had two other guys help but I did all the verification to make sure that memory worked. I think that my friends would describe me as the quintessential geek, I look at everything technical and just love it.
        </p>

        <h4>What distributions of Linux/Unix are you familiar with?</h4>
        <p>UCB Linux or Unix rather, Berkley 4.1… I still have the Devil Book sitting on the bookshelf somewhere and I believe I have a full set of them somewhere, they’re heirlooms now though. I run Ubuntu now for the most part. I use a lot of different distributions; I’ve even created some of my own. I’ve done low level programming and device programing with Linux which is a lot of fun if you’ve never done it. I’ve written all the way from machine code all the way up to patient programs, graphics programs, websites, and things like that. I’ve haven’t done a lot of mechanical engineering, but I was responsible for some of that stuff, as well as [RFID] and analog/digital stuff as well. </p>

        <h4>Can you give us a description about your job, role, the industry you work in and what you do in your everyday work?</h4>
        <p>I came into Eloque as the Lead Designer for the Edge computer system, which essentially monitors the health of infrastructure. We attach optic fiber to a bridge and as it flexes and moves around, it changes the light and the frequency of what was returned which determines if there is structural damage or if it is weakening. I don’t deal with that or the optical stuff, but there’s a component called an Optical Interrogation Unit which gets the raw information and turns it into digital information and floating-point numbers, I'm in control and in charge of that box and the interpreting equipment; that’s my domain. Around four or five months ago I hired someone I had worked with for over 20 years to come in and help to manage that. We designed a board to aid in that computation we need to do so we can process it through the cellular network.
        <br><br>
        My day to day right now can consist of a wide range of things. Today we had a debacle. I guess you could say where we changed some values that we shouldn't have changed on a production system. If we've been working in the test environment, it wouldn't have been a problem. But as I had to go figure out what happened, right, we saw a bunch of data. We saw a very sketchy set of data on the servers, and it was my job to go figure out what happened and how to resolve that. So essentially anything that goes wrong, I must be responsible for it and understand it. On some days is that means I get to sit and a read and write code for have new optical interrogator. We're checking out that came from a different partner. It has a different protocol. I'm used to being in an embedded world, you know, where it's very dirty, noisy, and terrible, so we have to take some really nice equipment and move it there. We're working with lots of different companies and people to redesign their system to fit into a harsher environment, which entails a lot of redundancy and things you wouldn't normally do, which they haven't thought of.
        <br><br>
        I have the experience to understand all the parts of the system to be able to solve it. We don't know. One day I'm writing code. The next day I'm dealing with management issues. Another day I'm trying to figure out how we purchased equipment which right now is unattainable. You know, another day I'm dealing with the supplier that screwed something up and we must get it fixed. You know? It's a wide range of things, but then again, you know my goals are split between managing people and getting to understand the flow of our systems.
        </p>

        <h4>What aspects of your position do you find to be the most rewarding and the most challenging?</h4>
        <p>I get this question a lot from a younger engineer when they're just out of school, I sit them down and tell them you don't make your money designing stuff, you make your money-making stuff work. Any person worth their salt can go off and design a circuit, you can sit down and build a schematic and get it through the board design and get the board up, get it all assembled and whatnot. Getting that sucker to work? That's the hard part. Taking a program and breaking it down. That's kind of really hard. Getting it to work in the real-world environment or how you're going to use it, that's where you make your money. That's the really hard part. That's where a lot of engineers have trouble converting that book knowledge that they have engineering in school to the real-world environment where that stuff doesn't matter. It's getting the job done. We almost don't care how you do it, as long as it's done.
        <br> <br>
        I've done a lot of different things in my career, about 15 years of verification. That's hard, chip verification is difficult because you get one shot at it. If you’re a software guy you come in, you screw up and you’re just to compile away from being perfect again, you’re fine. Man, when you're a hardware guy and just screw something up, it means you have to re-spin the entire board and the chip. But spinning a chip costs $1,000,000. You screw up and it's it costs money, but when your software guy you just recompile 5 minutes later. When you screw up with a with a board, it's a blue wire on there or change something. It costs money. Hardware, I think is more difficult than software because you have more latitude on how you fix things.
        <br> <br>
        That's kind of that's kind of what the hard parts are, so when you when you start being able to get stuff done in the in the lab and understand how to make that stuff work, that’s the where the real fun is.
        </p>

        <h4>How much has your job been affected by the chip shortages? </h4>
        <p>I'm doing boards right now, but we've had not only chip shortages, but we send our boards out to be manufactured and our manufacturer has some of our lost components. To give you an idea, we sent them 2000 resistors on our reel, they needed 800. We sent him 2000 expecting get most of those back. We got back 84. I'm like where the hell did all my resistors go? I'll give you one or two percent, I'll give you a little bit of shrinkage but I'm not giving you that much. And across the board, you know, in terms of costs, they last about $2000, not a big deal. But finding those parts right now? That's a big deal. That's where I had to hire someone who is spending a lot of his time looking for parts.
        <br> <br>
        We did not work well with our supplier, they ran out of a unit we needed, and we couldn't find anymore. So, I literally scoured the US and found a supplier that had. If your company is based on installing stuff on bridges and you run shy and you must stop, that's a real problem. The chip shortages are quite severe. I've never even heard of something like this in the 30 plus years I've been doing this. They're projected to go on through mid-next year or two, so it's not we're not done by any means.
        </p>

        <h4>What qualifications did you acquire to be in the position you are today, and how did you acquire them? </h4>
        <p>My degree is in computer engineering, and I think that through on the job learning and training, the initial starting point I got in college gave me the basis for a beginning to where I am today, 30 years down the road.
        <br> <br>
        When you're an individual contributor wow my manager sucks or he's good and when I get there, I'm going to be so much better than him or I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that so much better. And when you're the individual contributor, you don't have to deal with a lot of the nonsense. You just focus on bits and diddling and whatnot. But throughout my career of individual contributors, there was a lot of focus on the work. At one point, my boss, you know, you got this opportunity. Do you want to stay in individual contributor and go out the kind of technical route or you do want to manage? And what I've learned through my process of these different jobs I've had is that there are a lot of people that think they can manage, and they can't.
        <br> <br>
        Especially in engineering where the mindset is you have a problem, you have an answer then you go to the next problem, that's the mindset that you go through engineering school. When you get into industry, that's exactly how you see things. When I have the answer, I can put up box forgot about it. You end up with a lot of managers come up through the ranks of engineering who don't understand what being a manager means. And I was very fortunate to have a boss at the time who understood that and sent me off to classes to learn what it was. That the job I was embarking on was nothing like what I ever learned before.
        </p>

        <h4>How does your current role differ from the dream job you thought you would be in when you first entered the industry?</h4>
        <p>I mean I'm kind of living the dream right here to be honest. You know, I can look back to when I was in high school and say I always wanted to be an engineer student. I was always screwing around with this or screwing around with that and how things worked and being just naturally curious. This job is just an offshoot of that. I don't know if I had a preconceived notion about what the industry was. Certainly, it has changed a great deal since I entered it, it’s no longer the pocket protector tie and clipped haircut group, but I started with those guys.
        </p>

        <h4>Do you have any advice for a young professional looking to get into the IT Industry?</h4>
        <p>The kind of things that aren't stressed a lot in school are things like ethics and it's this in personal integrity stuff that's important when you get out into industry, at some point you're going to take a job that that kind of sucks, it's not all roses and fairy tales. There are some ugly parts, I've had some great bosses and I've had some lousy bosses. Try to learn what you can, try not to get too caught up in the day to day and the work, there are certain things they're going to frustrate you, but there will be somethings that'll be fun. Try having a life outside of work, it took me a few years… a lot of years in fact, to figure out that work life balance.
        </p>

        <h4>How are microcomputers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduino's used in your industry?</h4>
        <p>I have used Raspberry Pis a lot when I was doing my own company. We used them quite a bit for rapid prototyping. Since they were inexpensive and they handled things well, we went to market with a few of the designs just to build something that fit our needs completely and succinctly. It was cheaper to buy that platform then to build our own. It was it was overkill for what we needed, but it was inexpensive.
        <br> <br>
        I am not a big fan of Arduino type systems. I still think that's more of a lower end hobbyist thing. I think that if I'm going to go to that level with that kind of complexity, I would probably do it by myself. In other words, hand and build whatever I needed to build with bare metal programming. I built an access point in a weekend for a for a task that we needed. It translated from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi and vice versa, and I had it up and running in a weekend.
        </p>

        <h4>Where do you see microcomputer technology going in the near future and beyond?</h4>
        <p>Back when I got started, there were just a handful of microcontrollers and now everybody has one, they all do different things, and they all have different pluses and minuses. What I think we're seeing is more integration of features, making it simpler. Refrigerators are getting more intelligent; we have Siri and Alexa and voice activated systems. They're going to become more and more intelligent, more and more prevalent and integrated into our society. Growing up, we had TV's that were black and white. They’re colour now, you wouldn't even know what to do with the TV. You kind of look at it as ancient history.
