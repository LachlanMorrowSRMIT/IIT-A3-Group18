        <h2>Team Personal Information:</h2>
        <h3>Lachlan M:</h3>
        <img src="Images/Lachlan.jpg" alt="A photo of Lachlan!" style="width:300px;">
        <p>Hi! My name is Lachlan Morrow (s3942121@student.rmit.edu.au). I’m 24, and was born & raised in Victoria, Australia, though my family is of Irish heritage. My only spoken language is English, though I know a little bit of French. After graduating from high school in 2015, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development & Graduate Diploma of Management from 2016-2018. Since then, I’ve worked as an independent game developer. My hobbies and interests include gaming, modern history, video editing, music & film.<br>
        <br>Fun fact, I’m also really into tabletop roleplaying games! I almost always have at least one ongoing game running as either a player or a GM, and enjoy a variety of games including Dungeons & Dragons(5E), Pathfinder, World Of Darkness(WoD & CofD), Star Wars (Fantasy Flight) & Warhammer 40K (Only War & Dark Heresy).</p>

        <h3>Dominic G:</h3>
        <img src="Images/Dominic.jpg" alt="A photo of Dominic!" style="width:20%;height:20%;">
        <p>My name is Dominic Grkow (s3945746), I’m originally from “windy” Wellington, New Zealand in which I lived there for seven years, I am also part Irish, Macedonian and Polish. For a drastic change my family and I moved to Poland 17803 km away, in a small town called Czestochowa were I attended primary school. Then we finally situated in Melbourne, Australia were i finished my primary school and secondary college education. In the free time I enjoy having a hit of tennis which I have been playing for around ten years, in addition, I’ve played Alto Saxophone since I was 12 years old and studied it in my final year of secondary college which was a challenge during lockdown. My interest in IT started in primary school where I would have weekly IT classes and would always look forward to it. I truly settled IT as a career choice in the future in year 10 of secondary college. Seeing lines of code turn into a fully functional program was truly fascinating to me. Currently I’m interested in cyber security and software development as it has many options and pathways to go into in the future and that it’s a growing field to go into as we continually learn new thing to protect and develop different IT systems. So far, I’ve had some experience in IT learning to code in C++ and python as well as using Unity. </p>

        <h3>Max R:</h3>
        <img src="Images/Max.png" alt="A photo of Max!" style="width:20%;height:20%;">
        <p>My name is Max Rose and I am 20 years old. I was born in Brisbane and I have lived in Melbourne since I was one year old, however I am 50% Croatian from my Mothers side. Since prep, I attended Melbourne Grammar School moving from the Caulfield campus to the South Yarra Campus when I graduated to middle and high school. After I finished my secondary education, I took part in a Bachelor of Media and Communications at RMIT however I decided to defer my studies for the second semester as I wasn’t satisfied with my course and decided to join the Army Reserves as a member of the RASigs Corps (Royal Australian Signals). I decided to change my course to Bachelor of IT as it was always something that I have loved and been interested in! I am an avid masochist when it comes to gaming, so my favourite series are the Souls series and the ‘Souls-like’ games from FromSoftware. My favourite games of all time in no order are Bloodborne, Destiny 2, Slay the Spire, Dark Souls 3, Pokémon Heart Gold, Thumper (I beg you to please check this one out, absolute hidden gem), Doom Eternal, Death Stranding and XCOM 2.

        <h3>Neo T:</h3>
       <img src="Images/Neo.jpg" alt="A photo of Neo!" style="width:12%;height:12%;">
        <p>My name is Neo Ta, I am of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent, from my father and mother respectively. I studied in Werribee Secondary College.
           Hobbies of mine include playing games, playing piano and making videos of whatever I feel like making (though I'm not that good either).
           I cook once a week, so I like to think I'm good at it.<br>
           I also have 3 cats, very epico.</p>

        <h3>Joaquin R:</h3>
        <img src="Images/Joaquin_profile.png" alt="A photo of Joaquin!" style="width:20%;height:20%;">
        <p>Hello, my name is Joaquin I was born overseas in Uruguay and came here when I was only 3 months old and am an only child. My whole family was born in Uruguay so my family's culture is still very much rooted there and we visit family there every once in a while although due to the covid we haven’t been back in a while. Due to my whole family regularly speaking Spanish while I was growing up, I naturally picked up on it. However, while I mostly understand the language, I struggle at speaking it fluently. My education to date just consists of just prep – year 12 and some online programming courses I have done in my spare time.
I recently moved into Collingwood from Taylors Lakes (western suburb) at the beginning of this year primarily due to its closer proximity to many universities, especially RMIT. I love animals and have 2 cats named Luna and Lily which I adopted from an animal shelter, originally we were only going to adopt only one cat however the kitten (Luna) we wanted to adopt was with her mother and we felt bad only adopting one. My hobbies primarily consist of gaming in which I play pretty much everything from emulating retro consoles to playing the newer releases like Elden Ring. Other than gaming I also love music listening to a wide variety of genres but primarily hip hop, vaporwave and hyper-pop and casually collect records.</p>

        <h3>Kiet N:</h3>
        <img src="Images/Kiet.jpg" alt="A photo of Kiet!" style="width:20%;height:20%;">
        <p>Hello! My name is Kiet Nguyen. I live in Cranbourne and I am of Vietnamese heritage. The languages that I am able to speak include Vietnamese and English. My latest academic achievement is the completion of year 12 and Information Technology is my first university course. I basically have no prior experience with IT as my school did not teach it so I had to learn most of the things I needed (mainly HTML and CSS) from scratch. In my spare time, I like to draw and to play video games. I also like to spend an absurd amount of money for a children's card game (Yu-Gi-Oh!).</p>

        <h3>What does this mean for the group?</h3>
        <p>Our group primarily consists of Prospective Introverts, knowing this, whilst communication might have been difficult at first, everyone was able to work hard to pull their weight with little issue once roles had been decided.<br>
           Learning styles and personality types within our team vary considerably, this is a positive as variety within teams means that weaknesses and strengths are able to be made up for one another and different perspectives of issues and solutions are brought up.
