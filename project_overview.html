        <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>
        <p>[Placeholder text]</p>

        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>Roles for this project have been divided up as follows:<br>
            Dominic – Lead software development<br>
            Neo – Software development<br>
            Max – Lead Hardware development<br>
            Joaquin – Hardware development<br>
            Kiet – Website development<br>
            Lachlan – Project Management/Planning
            <br><br>
            We also have divided up parts of the report between the team, with the majority of the report being written by Kiet & Lachlan, with the hardware & software developers contributing to sections related to their areas.
            </p>

        <h2>Scope & Limits</h2>
        <h3>Milestone 1:</h3>
        <p>
            On a hardware level, this milestone is focused on assembling and configuring all the hardware components of the Arduino system, and implementing very basic code to allow us to read the water level of a bowl using the water sensor.
            <br><br>
            On a software level, this milestone is focused on developing a Figma wireframe of the mobile app controlling the device. This wireframe would be used as a guide for designing the actual functional prototype in Unity as part of Milestone 2.
            <br><br>
            Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to deliver the above artifacts as described.
        </p>

        <h3>Milestone 2:</h3>
        <p>
            On a hardware level, this milestone is focused on programming the wireless connectivity functionality into the Arduino system, and enabling the environment to interact with the mobile app being developed in tandem.
            <br><br>
            On a software level, this milestone is focused on developing a functional Unity Prototype mobile app based off of the Figma wireframe developed in Milestone 1, capable of wirelessly interfacing with the Arduino hardware.
            <br><br>
            Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to deliver the above artifacts as described.            
        </p>

        <h3>Milestone 3:</h3>
        <p>
            On a hardware level, this milestone is focused on expanding the range of functions provided by the Arduino system, including but not limited to the ability to automatically dispense pet food and water based on a schedule set by the mobile app. This also includes developing a robust mounting system for the device, allowing it to work reliably in real-world conditions with pet water & food bowls.
            <br><br>
            On a software level, this milestone is focused on further developing the Unity Prototype from Milestone 2 into full commercial grade product, as well as integrating support for the additional features planned for the Arduino system in this milestone.
            <br><br>
            Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to deliver the above artifacts as described.            
        </p>

        <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <p>In the course of scoping out this project, we have defined 3 major milestones, with each being less clearly defined and planned out due to the agile nature of our software development workflow. Prior to and during the beginning of each milestone we will be running an in-depth meeting with each team member to assign estimated completion times to each task, and using this to develop a Gantt Chart to help track progress throughout the milestone. Below we define each of the 3 major milestones.</p>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>Below are some potential major risks for this project:
            <br><br>
            •	Due to the lack of experience of many group members in this kind of work, task time estimates may be severely inaccurate, leading to scheduling problems and delays.
            <br><br>
            •	There is the potential for issues with the functionality of our purchased hardware components, including them not working as we believed them to.
            <br><br>
            •	There is potential for accidental damage to the hardware components, which would result in delays while we purchase replacement parts.
            <br><br>
            •	We may have severely underestimated the complexity of either the app or Arduino programming, and particularly the code behind getting the two to be able to properly communicate, as this is something none of the team have experience in. This could result in major delays or even a shift in the focus of the project if we were to realise that this is not feasible at all.
            <br><br>
            •	As many of the team also work part time, these commitments could generally get in the way of work on the project and cause delays.
            </p>

        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
        <p>All group communication is planned to take place either in person or over Microsoft Teams. We have agreed to 2 meetings a week via Microsoft Teams, one on each Saturday/Sunday and one on each Tuesday. At each of these meetings we will discuss any outstanding issues/topics that have cropped up that week, as well as update the team on each member’s progress on their assigned work, review that work and set new goals for the next meeting. With the frequency of these meetings, it is hoped that we can be agile and effectively adapt to any changing circumstances, resulting in a consistent work schedule.
            <br><br>
            Meeting agendas are written up prior to each meeting in a word document by the meeting head and shared with the team on Microsoft Teams. The whole team is encouraged to add to the agenda any topics they deem worth discussing. During each meeting, a scribe is elected in a rotating fashion from the team, to note down all conclusions reached on agenda topics, which are recording in an ‘Actions’ document. Each meeting is also recorded and transcribed.
            <br><br>
            Team members who miss meetings are provided with these ‘Actions’ documents and the meeting recording, and expected to review them when possible in order to stay aware of the work that has been assigned to them.
            <br><br>
            Team members are all also expected to meet every Wednesday during our practical class, and use this time to work on the project. Team members are also encouraged to contact each other outside of meeting and class times in order to collaborate on tasks and request feedback on their work.
