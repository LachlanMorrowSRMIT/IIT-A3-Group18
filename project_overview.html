        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Overview</h1>
        
        <h2>Topic</h2>
        For our project we will be developing a hardware solution that monitors water level of a pet’s water bowl and will notify the user through a mobile application when the water level has gone below a specified point. The purpose of this is to ensure that pet owners can keep their pets hydrated and provide 24/7 access to water. This solution will be achieved through an Arduino microcontroller which allows for rapid development of basic hardware prototypes with minimal prior experience necessary to end up with a finished product. The software component of this project will be developed using unity with many wireframe designs being constructed beforehand to provide us with the applications layout and basic functionalities. The communication of data between the Arduino and software necessary will be achieved using the local Wi-Fi network using it to send data back and forth between the hardware and software. <br><br>
        
It is expected that this solution will help busy pet owners who don’t have all day to monitor their pet’s water as this process will become automatic. This ensures that pet owners can also monitor water supply remotely when they are away from home providing a peace of mind to pet owners. The solution will work efficiently and be fully functional with the sensor constantly reading water levels to ensure that it is always being tracked and communicating this data with the mobile application. The solution will be accompanied by a simple plastic housing that will protect the hardware components from both water and accidental damage. Additionally, the mobile application will contain various additional features that will help the users to manage their time such as setting reminders for the user on particular days and repeating notifications until the user has refilled their pets bowl. The aim is for the product to be both easy to install and cost effective while providing ample benefit to both the user and their pet. <br><br> 
        
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        The motivation for this project is that many pets needs are often accidently neglected by owners due to their busy lifestyles and this product attempts to alleviate some of that hardship by helping pet owners to manage and track their pets water supply. This project also contains multiple areas that our team members have found interesting to work on and learn more of, with the project requiring both software and hardware components. The project was also interesting to work on due to its scalable nature meaning we could scale the project up or down depending on our progress and if we occurred any roadblocks. The project fits in with new emerging IT trends such as DIY computing devices that have popularised over the years as the prototype will implement the use of a Arduino microcontroller. The project can also be considered a smart home appliance which have been growing in popularity with many homes now days coming with some sort of smart home function as the technology continues to get more advanced. This project would show a future employer that we are skilled in both the hardware and software side of information technology and are able to work with widely used technology such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and implement them in our product. The completion of a project like this would also show key project management skills that are crucial. <br><br>

  
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
        Most of the similar products available are DIY projects of other individuals which cause an alarm to go off or led light to turn on when the water level reaches a specific point. However, a key differentiating factor of our project to these prexisting DIY ones is the mobile application component that is integrated with the hardware. This is because the similar products are only able to alert a user of low water level in their pets’ water bowl if they physically present whereas the mobile application will receive this data through Wi-Fi from the hardware and communicate this data to the user through various functions. The main competitor is mainly the PETKIT smart bowl which includes a mobile application similar to our project. However, this application is independent and not linked to the bowl unlike our idea which has the bowl transmitting data to the application.<br><br>

        <h2>Scope & Limits</h2>
        <h3>Milestone 1:</h3>
        <p>
            On a hardware level, this milestone is focused on assembling and configuring all the hardware components of the Arduino system, and implementing very basic code to allow us to read the water level of a bowl using the water sensor.
            <br><br>
            On a software level, this milestone is focused on developing a Figma wireframe of the mobile app controlling the device. This wireframe would be used as a guide for designing the actual functional prototype in Unity as part of Milestone 2.
            <br><br>
            Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to deliver the above artifacts as described.
        </p>

        <h3>Milestone 2:</h3>
        <p>
            On a hardware level, this milestone is focused on programming the wireless connectivity functionality into the Arduino system, and enabling the environment to interact with the mobile app being developed in tandem.
            <br><br>
            On a software level, this milestone is focused on developing a functional Unity Prototype mobile app based off of the Figma wireframe developed in Milestone 1, capable of wirelessly interfacing with the Arduino hardware.

            Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to deliver the above artifacts as described.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <p>In the course of scoping out this project, we have defined 3 major milestones, with each being less clearly defined and planned out due to the agile nature of our software development workflow. Prior to and during the beginning of each milestone we will be running an in-depth meeting with each team member to assign estimated completion times to each task, and using this to develop a Gantt Chart to help track progress throughout the milestone. Below we define each of the 3 major milestones.</p>
        <p> Software Tools and Technologies:
             <br><br>
            Figma (interface design tool)
            <br><br>

            Only requires an account, with using a student email provides full access. The group members working on the prototype have prior knowledge with using Figma, using it in User Centred Design assignments and classes. Understands the use of frames and how to set up the prototype to be fully functional within Figma.
            <br><br>
            Unity Editor (version: 2021.3.1f1)
            <br><br>
            Required to download onto computer, required an free account; first need to install unity hub then unity editor. Only one of the group members in the software team (Dominic) has experience with using unity. Includes 3D game design for Virtual Reality and understanding of the unity platform and how to code C++ which is the language unity is in. Also the team lead (Lachlan) has experience in unity with a game developer background, holding an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>[Placeholder text]</p>

        <h2>Timeframe</h2>
        <p>[Placeholder text]</p>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>Below are some potential major risks for this project:
            <br><br>
            •	Due to the lack of experience of many group members in this kind of work, task time estimates may be severely inaccurate, leading to scheduling problems and delays.
            <br><br>
            •	There is the potential for issues with the functionality of our purchased hardware components, including them not working as we believed them to.
            <br><br>
            •	There is potential for accidental damage to the hardware components, which would result in delays while we purchase replacement parts.
            <br><br>
            •	We may have severely underestimated the complexity of either the app or Arduino programming, and particularly the code behind getting the two to be able to properly communicate, as this is something none of the team have experience in. This could result in major delays or even a shift in the focus of the project if we were to realise that this is not feasible at all.
            <br><br>
            •	As many of the team also work part time, these commitments could generally get in the way of work on the project and cause delays.
            </p>

        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
        <p>All group communication is planned to take place either in person or over Microsoft Teams. We have agreed to 2 meetings a week via Microsoft Teams, one on each Saturday/Sunday and one on each Tuesday. At each of these meetings we will discuss any outstanding issues/topics that have cropped up that week, as well as update the team on each member’s progress on their assigned work, review that work and set new goals for the next meeting. With the frequency of these meetings, it is hoped that we can be agile and effectively adapt to any changing circumstances, resulting in a consistent work schedule.
            <br><br>
            Meeting agendas are written up prior to each meeting in a word document by the meeting head and shared with the team on Microsoft Teams. The whole team is encouraged to add to the agenda any topics they deem worth discussing. During each meeting, a scribe is elected in a rotating fashion from the team, to note down all conclusions reached on agenda topics, which are recording in an ‘Actions’ document. Each meeting is also recorded and transcribed.
            <br><br>
            Team members who miss meetings are provided with these ‘Actions’ documents and the meeting recording, and expected to review them when possible in order to stay aware of the work that has been assigned to them.
            <br><br>
            Team members are all also expected to meet every Wednesday during our practical class, and use this time to work on the project. Team members are also encouraged to contact each other outside of meeting and class times in order to collaborate on tasks and request feedback on their work.
