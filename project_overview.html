        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Overview</h1>
        
        <h2>Topic</h2>
       <p> For our project we will be developing a hardware solution that monitors water level of a pet’s water bowl and will notify the user through a mobile application when the water level has gone below a specified point. The purpose of this is to ensure that pet owners can keep their pets hydrated and provide 24/7 access to water. This solution will be achieved through an Arduino microcontroller which allows for rapid development of basic hardware prototypes with minimal prior experience necessary to end up with a finished product. The software component of this project will be developed using unity with many wireframe designs being constructed beforehand to provide us with the applications layout and basic functionalities. The communication of data between the Arduino and software necessary will be achieved using the local Wi-Fi network using it to send data back and forth between the hardware and software. <br><br> 
        
It is expected that this solution will help busy pet owners who don’t have all day to monitor their pet’s water as this process will become automatic. This ensures that pet owners can also monitor water supply remotely when they are away from home providing a peace of mind to pet owners. The solution will work efficiently and be fully functional with the sensor constantly reading water levels to ensure that it is always being tracked and communicating this data with the mobile application. The solution will be accompanied by a simple plastic housing that will protect the hardware components from both water and accidental damage. Additionally, the mobile application will contain various additional features that will help the users to manage their time such as setting reminders for the user on particular days and repeating notifications until the user has refilled their pets bowl. The aim is for the product to be both easy to install and cost effective while providing ample benefit to both the user and their pet. </p> 
        
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>  The motivation for this project is that many pets needs are often accidently neglected by owners due to their busy lifestyles and this product attempts to alleviate some of that hardship by helping pet owners to manage and track their pets water supply. This project also contains multiple areas that our team members have found interesting to work on and learn more of, with the project requiring both software and hardware components. The project was also interesting to work on due to its scalable nature meaning we could scale the project up or down depending on our progress and if we occurred any roadblocks. The project fits in with new emerging IT trends such as DIY computing devices that have popularised over the years as the prototype will implement the use of a Arduino microcontroller. The project can also be considered a smart home appliance which have been growing in popularity with many homes now days coming with some sort of smart home function as the technology continues to get more advanced. This project would show a future employer that we are skilled in both the hardware and software side of information technology and are able to work with widely used technology such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and implement them in our product. The completion of a project like this would also show key project management skills that are crucial.</p>

  
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
    <p> Most of the similar products available are DIY projects of other individuals which cause an alarm to go off or led light to turn on when the water level reaches a specific point. However, a key differentiating factor of our project to these prexisting DIY ones is the mobile application component that is integrated with the hardware. This is because the similar products are only able to alert a user of low water level in their pets’ water bowl if they physically present whereas the mobile application will receive this data through Wi-Fi from the hardware and communicate this data to the user through various functions. The main competitor is mainly the PETKIT smart bowl which includes a mobile application similar to our project. However, this application is independent and not linked to the bowl unlike our idea which has the bowl transmitting data to the application. </p>



        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Detailed Description</h1>

        <h2>Aims</h2>
        <p>Specific aim:
            <br>Use off the shelf components to construct a device (Arduino) that can communicate with a phone application in order to dispense pet food and water. <br>       
This goal is a very broad overview of what we are trying to achieve in this project, with that just being the culmination of all our work so far across the past two Assignments. To break that down into S.M.A.R.T goals they need to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound so that they are clear, set out and easy to follow: <br>
Decide on affordable, simple and capable hardware, purchase it and put it in working order for the next step ASAP. <br>
This goal is specific as it clearly sets out what we need to do, it is measurable as we physically purchase the item, it is relevant as it directly relates to our specific aim of constructing a device and it is also time bound to complete it ASAP for the software team to start on programming. This specific goal has the dependency of the secondary goal as none of the software can be completed without the hardware being completed. <br> <br>
Design and code software for the Arduino that communicates wirelessly with a phone to send a notification in order tell the user certain messages, by the 28th of May.  <br>
This goal is specific as it clearly sets out what needs to be done, it is measurable as it specifics what the program should achieve, it is achievable as based on our research in previous assignments we did thorough investigation into whether it is possible, it is relevant as it relates to the specific aim, and it is time bound as it specifies a date in which it needs to be completed. This specific goal is completely dependent on the hardware goal as it cannot be completed without the environment being set up and ready to go.  <br> <br>
Complete a detailed report of the findings from our in-depth research which includes scope and limits, project roles, skills and jobs, risks, aims and goals, timeframe and ongoing updates to plans and progress. Must be completed by the 28th of May.  <br>
This goal is specific as it very clearly sets out and demonstrates all the individual parts of the report that must be included, it is measurable as it’s a report so it will constantly be updated with new additions from different people who have been assigned certain sections, it is achievable as our extensive research and discussion as a group has allowed us to work on a feasible and reasonable idea for our Assignment project, it is relevant as it directly relates to all of the documentation needed as well as the research needed to inform and make the correct decisions, and finally, it is time-bound as out assignment has specific due date on the 28th of May. This is not dependant on either the software or the hardware, however, having them completed will help immensely to create an in-depth report. </p>

        <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>
        <p>As described in the Project Description, PETDUINO is a project intended to create a commercially viable hardware kit, made up of off-the-shelf Arduino components, in order to measure the water level of a pet’s water bowl. This hardware kit is then paired with a proprietary mobile application, which receives the data the hardware kit transmits over Wi-Fi and displays it to the user. <br> <br>
The story of the project began with the pitch for it from one of our group members, Joaquin. Below he talks about how he came up with the idea. <br>
“I had previously started taking an interest in Arduinos and how they work extensively reading into them during my free time about how they work and what can be projects can be created with them. Then I had found out that we had to come up with a project idea for class and because of my interest at the time in Arduino I wanted a project that could implement Arduino technology. This led to me looking for problems in my daily life that could be remedied using technology this resulted in me finding that I was frequently going out of my way to ensure my cats had a full bowl of water every morning. I came to the realisation that this problem could be solved using an Arduino solution. Knowing that just using an Arduino would be too simple an idea I decided to utilise my previous knowledge in mobile application development to add a mobile application component to work in conjunction with the Arduino system to improve the overall usefulness of the application. This application would have a variety of functions such as notifying user of low water levels through push notifications, schedule reminders and more.” <br> <br>
During one of our first meetings as a team, when we were determining which project to select to work on for the next few months, we settled on PETDUINO for two main reasons: <br>
The project is well suited for the interest and skillsets of the team, consisting of two separate hardware and software branches, it catered to the different members of the team with interest in either of these two areas. <br> <br>
The project was well scoped out, with easily mappable goals and milestones, at least some of which we knew we would be able to achieve within the given timeframe of the project. <br> <br>
Because of this, upon selecting the project we quickly got to work. The first month or so (Assignment 2) was more focused on nailing down the team’s aspirations, skills & dynamics in more detail in order to make sure that we would be a good fit for each other and determining the details of how we would execute on the project itself. <br> <br>
Our team worked very well together during this period, with constant communication and updates on progress, and excellent attendance in weekly meetings. This would continue for the remained of the project. <br> <br>
Towards the end of this stage, it was decided that we would split into 3 different 2 person teams for the duration of the project proper, with one member of each team acting as the lead, and handling co-ordination with the two others. These teams were ‘Hardware’, consisting of Max (Lead) and Joaquin, ‘Software’ consisting of Dominic (Lead) & Neo and ‘Production’, consisting of Lachlan (Lead) and Kiet. These 3 teams would each be responsible for different areas of the project, with the Hardware team handling the hardware components and Arduino board itself, as well as programming for it, the Software team handling the mobile app development, and the Production team handling the scheduling, documentation & management of the project, and the development of the team’s website. <br> <br>
Upon conclusion of Assignment 2, the team took an approximately 2 week long break, before beginning a week of pre-production for the project proper alongside the beginning of Assignment 3. This involved splitting the project into 3 distinct milestones, the details of which can be found in the Scope and Limits section of this document, and planning out the first in detail. This detailed planning involved meetings with all of the team members, where a list of tasks and estimated times for each of them were determined. At this stage it was also agreed that we would begin meeting more regularly twice a week instead of once a week, in order to better keep up with the project. That week we also began the process of purchasing the necessary Arduino components for the hardware team, which each team member paid their share of (approximately $10). Max who was in charge of purchasing the hardware provided the team with various hardware options we could use. The first option included an Arduino board with built in Wi-Fi or the second option was to buy an Arduino board and an additional Bluetooth module. We all then unanimously chose which Arduino board we would purchase coming to the decision to buy the Arduino with integrated Wi-Fi mainly due to the significantly lower cost and due to the fact that with the Bluetooth option we would have to connect the module to the Arduino board which would have added to the projects complexity. <br> <br>
Once the task list hosted on Trello was complete, a Gannt Chart was assembled with that information, and was shown to the team. This Gannt Chart would act as the scheduling plan for the first milestone of the project, and though it would be updated at each meeting to reflect progress on and changes to the schedule of the project. <br> <br>
In the following two weeks, work would continue on both the hardware and software sides. The hardware team ran into some issues with configuring and connecting to the Arduino initially as the person with the hardware (Max) had forgotten to install the drivers to the Arduino and his PC which resulted in some issues with the Arduino not showing up correctly in the IDE software (development tool). Once the rest of the team identified the issue, Max then went back and fixed the issue by installing the proper drivers and following the manuals found online to get the correct environment set up. This resulted in test code that was already on the Arduino being able to be used, code which allowed the user to turn an LED on the Arduino on and off. <br>
Firstly, shortly after receiving the Arduino board and sensor we successfully connected the Arduino using various jumper cables to the water sensor ensuring each cable was connected to the correct corresponding port. Afterwards, we moved to upload our test code to the Arduino microcontroller that would make it read the water level and display its readings through the Arduino IDE. However, when trying to upload the code to the Arduino microcontroller board we ran into a package error (ESP8266). We spent considerable time trying to fix the issue searching for solutions to this error and after trying various fixes such as rolling back updates, try older driver versions, uninstalling all drivers and reinstalling them back, hard resetting the Arduino, change the micro-USB cord over, running certain debugging test code as well as even trying on different computers but Max had no luck unfortunately. <br> <br>
The software team was able to complete their Figma prototype according to schedule, which can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/yQi2wckMGDvN5XIXueqkV7/Intro-to-IT-Assignment-3?node-id=8%3A1139&starting-point-node-id=8%3A1124&scaling=scale-down">here.</a></p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>We will test our project by testing several of Its’ functions and judging how intuitive navigation of the system’s user interface is. We will know if it is a successful prototype if users can easily understand the navigation and functions of the app. Our user testers will be through convenience sampling, consisting of friends and family members. Testing will be conducted via presenting each user tester with the Figma prototype and asking them to complete a series of tasks listed on a piece of paper. We will observe the tester attempting to complete each task taking notes on body language and visible signs of frustration. Additionally for each task the test subject will be asked to rate the difficulty of achieving that specific task on a scale of 1 to 10 in addition to possible improvements that could be made to streamline navigation and/or understandability. </p>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>Below are some potential major risks for this project:
            <br><br>
            •	Due to the lack of experience of many group members in this kind of work, task time estimates may be severely inaccurate, leading to scheduling problems and delays.
            <br><br>
            •	There is the potential for issues with the functionality of our purchased hardware components, including them not working as we believed them to.
            <br><br>
            •	There is potential for accidental damage to the hardware components, which would result in delays while we purchase replacement parts.
            <br><br>
            •	We may have severely underestimated the complexity of either the app or Arduino programming, and particularly the code behind getting the two to be able to properly communicate, as this is something none of the team have experience in. This could result in major delays or even a shift in the focus of the project if we were to realise that this is not feasible at all.
            <br><br>
            •	As many of the team also work part time, these commitments could generally get in the way of work on the project and cause delays.
            </p>

        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
        <p>All group communication is planned to take place either in person or over Microsoft Teams. We have agreed to 2 meetings a week via Microsoft Teams, one on each Saturday/Sunday and one on each Tuesday. At each of these meetings we will discuss any outstanding issues/topics that have cropped up that week, as well as update the team on each member’s progress on their assigned work, review that work and set new goals for the next meeting. With the frequency of these meetings, it is hoped that we can be agile and effectively adapt to any changing circumstances, resulting in a consistent work schedule.
            <br><br>
            Meeting agendas are written up prior to each meeting in a word document by the meeting head and shared with the team on Microsoft Teams. The whole team is encouraged to add to the agenda any topics they deem worth discussing. During each meeting, a scribe is elected in a rotating fashion from the team, to note down all conclusions reached on agenda topics, which are recording in an ‘Actions’ document. Each meeting is also recorded and transcribed.
            <br><br>
            Team members who miss meetings are provided with these ‘Actions’ documents and the meeting recording, and expected to review them when possible in order to stay aware of the work that has been assigned to them.
            <br><br>
            Team members are all also expected to meet every Wednesday during our practical class, and use this time to work on the project. Team members are also encouraged to contact each other outside of meeting and class times in order to collaborate on tasks and request feedback on their work.

        <h2>Skills & Jobs</h2>
        <p>In the event of significant investment in this project, the 4 key roles we would want to hire are as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Senior Software Developer</h3>
        <p>A Senior Software Developer would be a huge asset in the development of our mobile app. Particularly having someone with extensive experience in Unity Mobile development, in order to help inform and lead the team in that area.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Arduino/Microcomputer Expert</h3>
        <p>Similarly, an Arduino/Microcontroller Expert would be extremely valuable to help guide us in the development of functionality on a hardware level.</p>

        <h3>3. Marketing Expert</h3>
        <p>In the event of commercial investment, we will need someone with expertise in marketing to help sell our product and guide our development to match the needs of consumers, in order to develop a commercially successful product and provide returns for investors.</p>

        <h3>4. Chief Financial Officer</h3>
        <p>
            Similarly, to the Marketing Expert, we will need someone with experience managing the finances of a company in order to provide guidance to the team in that area and ensure financial success and sustainability for the project. 
            <br><br>
            Chief financial officers are top-level executives, often the third highest position in many businesses. The role of a chief financial officers is to oversee and record financial actions of the business, managing and reporting cash flow, all financial planning and potential taxation issues. 
            <br><br>
            This position requires prior experience in the industry, and whilst there are no other distinct prerequisites for this role, many working this role have backgrounds in fields such as accounting, investment banking and as market analysts.
