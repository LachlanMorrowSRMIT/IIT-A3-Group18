        <h2>Cybersecurty:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the overall concept of protecting different electronic data in servers, and personal computers and the ways we can take actions to achieve this protection. These actions are used to prevent hackers from gaining access to important data and information such as a company’s customers information including credit card details and personal information such as their address.  
<br> <br>
There are many threats that cybersecurity deals with, some common one’s include malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. Malware also known as viruses are software that are created to cause harm this can be done by the user simply clicking a link. Ransomware is a form of malware by as the name suggests the hacker requests a ransom for the company to have access to their systems. Phishing is typically presented as an email such as pretending to be as a bank requesting credit card information.  
<br> <br>
To deal with this, cybersecurity includes many technologies that are vital for protecting personal computers to organizations. Some simple technology includes antivirus software which its key role is to detect and remove malicious items on a computer/laptop some antivirus software include Avast, McAfee, and Norton. Another technology used in cybersecurity is DNS filtering which is a technology that allows the user to ensure the domain they are accessing to be free of malicious content, it acts as a filter for different website domains to determine whether it is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ DNS filtering is also used by organizations to prevent their workers from entering a specific site that could cause cybersecurity threats. 
<br> <br>
There are many types of cybersecurity this includes operational security, application security, network security and cloud security.
<br> <br>
Operational security consists of a plan for all cybersecurity risks. Usually created by a risk management officer that created a plan to ensure user’s data stored in a company’s server is secure even if an attack occurs. Some security practices used are making sure the employees of a company are well educated about cybersecurity threats. 
<br> <br>
Application security consists of the protection for applications we install on our personal devices. Some security practices currently used include a password from a user and using dual factor authentication.  
<br> <br>
Network security involves the protection of the network users and company’s use. It ensures only authorized users can access the network and block hackers/attackers. Some of the techniques used to protect against the network include firewalls also network attacks can usually come in the form as a phishing attack sent via email and could pose a risk to a business’s network thus email security is additionally important in network security. 
<br> <br>
Cloud security involves the protection of everything we store in the cloud, services such as OneDrive and Google Drive, also the protection for major organizations cloud servers. Some of the security practices used currently include ensuring the user’s network is secure, multiple options to back-up the data stored on the cloud and different encryption techniques.  
<br> <br>
All these different areas within cybersecurity are dealt with many professionals within the field including cybersecurity specialists, cybersecurity analysts, cybersecurity engineer and network engineer.  
<br> <br>
So right now, cybersecurity can currently do a lot including protecting individual computers and organizations confidential data, but currently it is increasingly difficult for law enforcement to prosecute these cybercrimes. However, what is the future of cybersecurity, currently the employment rate for cybersecurity specialists is not at a high level and not filling the positions required which could change with the current trends in cybersecurity. Some threats are planned to or are in trend include malware automation, polymorphic malware, and third-party software which could contain imbedded malware that could target the company’s system. In addition, the use of Internet of Things threats is continually increasing due to the continuous increase of individuals owning their own personal devices thus, in the future cybersecurity would focus a lot on the Internet of Things attacks.
        <sup><a href="references.html">[31]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[32]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[33]</a></sup></p>



        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The likely impact of cybersecurity includes many things such as protection and safety of personal computers and large data systems, knowledge of how we can further improve cybersecurity, and an overall reduction of cybersecurity threats.  
<br> <br>
Protection and safety will develop as the technology becomes more advance. Some of the technology they are developing now includes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, where the process of identifying security threats will become automatic and fully autonomous with minimal human interaction. This will reduce the amount of cybersecurity threats and attacks, as the process will become much faster and efficient as it is being completed by a computer which is more efficient than a human completing these tasks as it allows for more in-depth view into businesses computer systems. 
<br> <br>
People will have a greater knowledge of cybersecurity as the threats on personal computers become more prominent more courses are becoming available for people to learn how to protect themselves. As individuals pursue a greater understanding on how to manage and keep their personal computers more secure the amount of cybersecurity threats will decrease. This also helps with the resources that are available to individuals such as simple activating dual factor authentication making their accounts such as Google more secure and more difficult for hackers to enter and obtain their data.  
<br> <br>
Will reduce the cost for business to recover from cybersecurity attacks, as cybersecurity is continually growing at a fast pace the chance of a cybersecurity will decrease as it will become more difficult for hackers. In addition, as business become more aware of these threats more money will go into training there staff thus overall reducing the risks of a cybersecurity attack on their computer systems. Thus, reducing the costs of recovering and compensating their customers of data breaches that occur because of these attacks. 
       <sup><a href="references.html">[34]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[35]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[36]</a></sup> </p>

        <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity will affect us in many ways including creating a safer place for the internet for us and it will make us more aware of how we can prevent these cybersecurity attacks. As cybersecurity becomes more prevalent more technology will be released to deal with the threats on cybersecurity.  
<br> <br>
With cybersecurity become more prominent in this time, more people such as ourselves, are using personal devices making ourselves more vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Thus, with cybersecurity it allows us to install different applications such as Avast and Norton which allows us to better protect our personal devices, minimising hackers stealing and taking over our systems/data. In addition, as businesses become more aware of cybersecurity practices making their systems more secure, thus our data is more secure and less accessible to hackers as previously.  
<br> <br>
Also, cybersecurity also teaches us how to implement the practices into our own devices. Some of these practices include creating a secure password which limits the chance of hackers from gaining access to out accounts such as Google, in addition, to passwords a dual factor authentication is vital, these available solutions/features that the field of cybersecurity provides allowing us to better secure ourselves on the internet.  
<br> <br>
In addition, the more features available to us as stated above allows us to be more secure online, as cybersecurity is constantly developing and becoming more focused on, more of these features within different platforms are becoming available and accessible for us to use on our personal accounts. These features that are constantly becoming more common allows us to be more secure and ensure all our accounts are secure. It allows us to gain an extra layer of protection to our password. Thus overall, these new features impact us by providing a layer of protection that we can use to secure and protect our personal data that is being stored on the several accounts including Google and Facebook. 
            <sup><a href="references.html">[37]</a></sup> </p>

        <h2>Autonomous Vehicles:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Autonomous Vehicles are vehicles that require no human interactions with the use of sensors and cameras to map out the environment. They require many different technologies to work including sensors, machine learning system, actuators, and different processors to run the software required. An autonomous vehicle is sometimes mixed up with self-driving vehicles, but self-driving vehicles require a human to be always present such as Tesla’s.  
<br> <br>
So how do autonomous vehicles work, autonomous vehicles must use sensors to map out the environment they are in. To detect other cars that are within the range of the vehicle it requires specific sensors which are radar sensors. In addition, the use of lidar sensors it allows the car to identify different distances such as the distance of the car in front and provides the ability for the car to detect the lane marks. In addition, the vehicle requires cameras that are externally attached to monitor traffic lights, pedestrians, the different road signs in place, and an addition to radar sensors it also monitors other vehicles.  
<br> <br>
Currently autonomous vehicles are not widely used, this is due to different countries regulations and the instability of the technology currently. Some of the key issues include the different weather conditions we experience such as snow making the lanes unclear for the camera and sensor. In addition, when the vehicle does have accidents who is liable for the damage as the passenger has no control. However, autonomous vehicles do have positives with predictions of fuel prices reducing, reduction of traffic congestion in major cities and reducing carbon emission.  
<br> <br>
Some autonomous that have been used include the autonomous vehicles used in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics which were used to transport athlete around the Olympic village. However, they were temporarily suspended after a vehicle hit a visually impaired athlete. Which as highlighted earlier the current issues of autonomous cars. So currently autonomous vehicles are in small level trials including in the Mcity Test Facility within the University of Michigan where autonomous vehicles are being tested in complex environments. This small testing in isolated areas is currently what we are seeing with autonomous vehicles with the addition of it being used in the Tokyo Olympics as stated earlier having been required to be temporarily suspended. In addition, in China an autonomous vehicle without a human driver is being used within Shenzhen city within China but are currently only available for private guests not the general public as it is currently being tested. However, there are currently plans to test these vehicles seen below in Figure 1 within the Southeast of Asia which shows the likely future of these autonomous vehicles. 
<br> <br>
But what will autonomous vehicles be like in the future? Some of the current difficulties preventing autonomous cars of being widely used on the roads includes the safety of them with multiple reported issues of vehicles colliding with pedestrians. However currently taxis in Arizona, USA (United States of America) are currently being used on the road but is still currently in the testing phase but are reportedly being available to a larger scale in the next two years. Many experts within the autonomous vehicles field believe it will be a long time until they are readily available in the community due to the difficulties with the current design of streets and the complex environments it may face. However, in the next ten years there is to be many changes including the ability to use the autonomous vehicles as public transport including driverless buses and taxis, people owning their own autonomous will most likely not be possible due to the excessive costs and the limited availability.  
        <sup><a href="references.html">[38]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[39]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[40]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[41]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[42]</a></sup>
</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; width: 30%;" class="center">Figure 1: AutoX’s driverless vehicles by AutoX <sup><a href="references.html">[43]</a></sup> </p>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>With the further implementation of autonomous vehicles there are many impacts to the economy and society, including the reduction of traffic congestion, emission cut, transport costs reduced, and improve liveability.  
<br> <br>
The reduction of traffic congestion is likely the biggest impact of autonomous vehicles. The implementation of autonomous vehicles is expected to reduce traffic congestion due to the increase in better and more efficient traffic flow because of the higher road capacity. Also, because of reduced traffic congestion it will result in a reduction of roadway costs for country government and individuals. 
<br> <br>
Another impact is the driver safety, in America alone ‘35,092 people were killed in 2015…on U.S (United States). roads’ (Ohio University 2020, para. 8), the implementation of autonomous vehicles is expected to reduce ‘motor vehicle deaths by 90 percent’ (Ohio University 2020, para. 8). In addition to the lives lost, accidents greatly impact the economy with multiple resources required when an accident occurs resulting in large costs, with autonomous vehicles it is expected to also improve the economy especially in the healthcare sector. Also, with fewer car accidents the price of insurance will likely drop as people may not own a car and fewer accidents. 
<br> <br>
In addition, the reduction of emissions is likely to be positively impacted by autonomous vehicles. As most autonomous vehicles are predicted to be electric with reduced the level of fossil fuel emission into the atmosphere. The increase usage of these electric autonomous vehicles will likely contribute to the plan to become carbon neutral in multiple countries.  
<br> <br>
However, autonomous vehicles are most likely going to impact the jobs in transportation, with these vehicles most likely replacing buses and taxis. Also, farmers will most likely be replaced with autonomous vehicles being able to complete them with minimal human intervention. This will most likely impact individuals’ liveability, which will likely increase the unemployment rate resulting in the economy to weaken, however these autonomous vehicles will still provide jobs with maintenance and manufacturing. 
        <sup><a href="references.html">[44]</a></sup> <sup><a href="references.html">[45]</a></sup> </p>

        <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles have a profound effect on the reduction of pollution, lower cost of living and the option of not owning your own car will become easier.  
<br> <br>
As most of the autonomous cars are electric the positive health impact on us, due to the reduction of pollution. Thus, the result of the lower pollution levels it will reduce the chance of developing different health impacts including heart disease, respiratory diseases, stroke, and lung cancer. Overall, autonomous vehicles affect us in many ways including health.  
<br> <br>
In addition, as petrol will be less likely needed it should reduce the cost of requiring filling up an individual’s vehicle. This would affect me as it reduces the cost of living and able to use the money saved from using electricity instead can be used for other resources. Thus, making items that are required in everyday of living more accessible. Not only gas prices being redundant, but car insurance may not be needed, such as for my family members or friends who own car it could reduce their cost of insurance as they may not need to own a car, as autonomous vehicles are most likely going to work like taxis or renting a car. 
<br> <br>
Thus, for someone like my age who is unable to afford or purchase a vehicle it may reduce the pressure to require a vehicle as it may be easier to rent/request an autonomous vehicle to pick you up. Overall, making it easier for us to easily access locations as owning a car will not be as in demand as it is currently. Also, another effect autonomous vehicles on my family members or friends who drive a car daily is the limited stress it will cause on everyday driving, alleviating the need to worry about the other drivers on the road or the congestion on the road.

        <h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the recent years, there have been many “emerging small computing devices that provide an accessible and easy way for software developers” <sup><a href="references.html">[10]</a></sup> to start learning how to use various pieces of hardware to collect inputs and produce outputs. These computing devices include Arduino boards, Raspberry Pis and a variety of other “beginner hardware invention kits” <sup><a href="references.html">[11]</a></sup>. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform which utilizes various hardware components including a single-board microcontroller <sup><a href="references.html">[12]</a></sup>. The main reason Arduino is so easy to learn is due to the large community surrounding it, this results in a large knowledge base and abundance of resources that beginners can draw from when learning the platform (What is Arduino?, 2018). Raspberry Pi on the other hand is a “microprocessor-based minicomputer” <sup><a href="references.html">[13]</a></sup> which usually runs using a Linux based OS. In comparison to Arduino, a Raspberry Pi can “run multiple programs at once” <sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup> making it better suited to more complex projects partly also due to its “better processor allowing for more complex computations to take place” <sup><a href="references.html">[14]</a></sup>. Many other small computing devices perform similar functions to both Raspberries Pis and Arduinos such as BeagleBoard, Sharks Cove, Nanode etc. However, Arduinos and Raspberries Pis are by far the most widely used and recognised ones due to both ease of use and accessibility.
            <br>
            <br>



The applications for both Arduinos and Raspberry Pis are quite endless as they can be used in all sorts of DIY projects <sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup> from home automation to simple robotics. This is achieved through various sensors and modules <sup><a href="references.html">[17]</a></sup> that can be used in conjunction with them to either detect inputs or perform an output. One example of an individual who largely utilizes these devices to create interesting projects is Youtuber Michael Reeves who often uses both Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to program a wide variety of robotics. An example is when he made a Roomba that screams when bumping into various objects <sup><a href="references.html">[19]</a></sup>, this was achieved using a Raspberry Pi with a couple of optical sensors and a Bluetooth speaker. This shows how these devices can be utilized to produce output when certain inputs are detected by sensors for a wide variety of applications <sup><a href="references.html">[15]</a></sup>. Also, these devices allow people not familiar with the hardware aspect of programming to become exposed to the hardware and start learning how to use it to complete a wide variety of tasks. This allows them to build their knowledge using these beginner systems until they are comfortable enough to take what they have learned and apply it to the more complex hardware used in the industry.


<br>
<br>
In the future, these devices are expected to be able to continue to lower the cost of development using minicomputer and microcontrollers to make them more accessible to both hobbyists <sup><a href="references.html">[18]</a></sup> but also give developing countries access to these computing devices allowing them to modernise. This could include the implementation of “low-cost PLC controllers” for example which will help industrial automation <sup><a href="references.html">[20]</a></sup> reducing the amount of physical labour required in third world countries and help them localize manufacturing. Additionally, Arduino in the future once it becomes more efficient is going to allow companies to make products that are more easily customizable by consumers. For example, if someone buys a product and wishes it had an additional feature or if a current feature acted differently, they could take it into their own hands and program the new feature themselves. This would be possible due to the open-source nature of Arduino meaning that it acts the same across multiple products.  </p>
      <img class="center" src="Images/arduino.png" alt="Arduino design" style="width:40%;height:40%;">
        <p style="text-align: center; width: 30%;" class="center">Figure 3: Arduino <sup><a href="references.html">[30]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The impact of technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pis and other small computing devices is the increasing number of people that are going to start using hardware to solve problems they encounter in their everyday life. As we have seen over the last decade ever since the release and popularisation of these devices due to their ease of use and low entry cost more and more people than ever are deciding to create their own DIY projects using these tools as opposed to other microcontrollers/minicomputers which require extensive knowledge to use effectively. I could see this push for accessibility go even further with methods to program Arduinos and Rasberry Pis without any programming knowledge in the future so anyone could use them regardless of education. I think the people most affected by these devices will be the future generations that are interested in technology as it will allow them to start experimenting and making their own ideas with very little prerequisite knowledge being needed.
<br>
<br>


I also think that if products start implementing these open-source components it will allow consumers to have so much more freedom in modifying what they buy whether they want to change how it works or replace a broken component. Also, it will allow people who aren’t software engineering graduates etc. to develop and sell technology products that they come up with. As with any hardware that can potentially automate tasks there is a risk that this could impact manual labour jobs through the automation of mundane tasks. However, I believe that workers can work alongside these automated systems and due to the lower cost and increased efficiency it results in more workers needed to meet the demand <sup><a href="references.html">[19]</a></sup>.  I don’t think these accessible devices will replace regular microcontrollers and other more complex devices currently due to them having advantages in terms of space and energy efficiency which is a major factor in commercial products. </p>
<br>
<br>
        <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
        <p>This technology will affect me by providing me with an accessible way to start learning and creating hardware projects. This means with my already acquired IT knowledge I could start solving any problems I come across in my daily life developing hardware solutions for them and if found to be viable could be escalated into a business idea. This technology due to its low cost and ease of development will also mean that I can develop many prototypes to quickly get ideas into a tangible state. Aside from how this technology will affect me from a developer's point of view, there is also how it will affect me as a consumer. As a consumer if products start to feature Arduinos it will allow me to tinker and modify them additionally allows for me to replace broken components of a product much more easily.

 <br>
 <br>

Due to the open-source nature, it will be easy for me to learn platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This is because there are large communities surrounding each platform resulting in a lot of resources to learn from this means I will have a lot of past examples to learn from when making my own DIY projects and using these resources to circumvent any errors that may come across. Ultimately this means I will spend less time learning how to use the platform and more time using it to create stuff for a lack of a better term.

 <br>
 <br>

This technology will make it so that my friends and family members who are interested in DIY projects are more willing to implement microcontrollers and minicomputers into their projects as the barrier of entry to start using these computing devices is not high. Also if I use these devices to create something that benefits one of my family members or friends it means that the hardware as indirectly positively affected them as it allowed me to create it. </p>
<br>
 <br>
        <h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is essentially a “distributed ledger” <sup><a href="references.html">[21]</a></sup> which is a system that records the transaction details of assets <sup><a href="references.html">[22]</a></sup>. This data is recorded across many devices which are also referred to as nodes. These nodes are used to validate each transaction before storing them in blocks <sup><a href="references.html">[23]</a></sup>. Each block is a group of data of transactions with each block having a capacity on the amount of data that can be stored this results in the addition of more blocks therefore leading to a ‘blockchain’<sup><a href="references.html">[21]</a></sup>. Blocks all have a cryptographic hash which uniquely identifies each block and prevents from others seeing the data stored on a block <sup><a href="references.html">[24]</a></sup> by assigning a code of a fixed size to the block using a hash algorithm. This hash cannot be decrypted. It also ensures that each block has its own cryptographic hash securing each block's place relative to each other in the blockchain. All nodes on the blockchain keep track of the data stored on the blockchain across a period of time, additionally when data is stored on the blockchain it is permanent and cannot be altered.  Due to the transaction history of data being recorded over time, it allows for the “ownership history of any digital asset” to be readily available <sup><a href="references.html">[25]</a></sup>.
<br>
<br>

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies which utilize blockchain technology examples of these are Bitcoin Ethereum, Dogecoin etc. Due to using blockchain technology all transactions of these cryptocurrencies are recorded and very secured. Cryptocurrencies are like any other currency in that they can be used to make a variety of purchases from whoever accepts them as payment <sup><a href="references.html">[26]</a></sup>. As cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin have grown more popular over the last decade more and more companies even governments are starting to recognise bitcoin as a legitimate payment method. Another benefit of cryptocurrencies is that they exist on a decentralised system this means that they can be sent to any country without requiring any currency conversions and are kept by the user, not an external entity such as a bank. One downside of cryptocurrencies however, is the extreme volatility associated with them, this is due to the large amount of speculation surrounding their usefulness from the public resulting in both large price surges and major drops.
<br>
<br>


Another aspect of blockchain technology related to cryptocurrency is miners. They are people involved in the creation of new blocks via mining <sup><a href="references.html">[25]</a></sup>. This is achieved by using high-level computers to solve very complicated mathematical equations. Solving these equations is essentially verifying each transaction made on the blockchain <sup><a href="references.html">[26]</a></sup>. Miners who are the first to have either the equal or closest answer will be paid in the corresponding cryptocurrency for example those mining bitcoin would receive a certain amount of bitcoin.

 <br>
<br>

Ethereum uses “traditional blockchain functionality” <sup><a href="references.html">[25]</a></sup> however it also allows for computer code to be executed on the blockchain. This results in programs being able to communicate through the blockchain. These programs can then use tokens which can represent any digital asset and because this is done via blockchain technology anyone can track ownership of the particular asset. These tokens lead to newly popularised NFTs (Non-Fungible-Tokens) which are tokens that can store art, music and a variety of other digital files. Creators have an option to take a percentage of any sales made involving the NFT allowing them to benefit if it balloons in price. Many companies and mainstream artists are starting to get into the NFT market due to how the absurd prices they can go for. For example, Grimes a music artist sold a video named “Death of the Old” that went for $389,000 <sup><a href="references.html">[27]</a></sup>. Some have taken it a step further using NFT to sell player virtual land plots and characters in blockchain-based videogames. </p>
<br>

        <p style="text-align: center; width: 30%;" class="center">Figure 4: Cryptocurrency <sup><a href="references.html">[29]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>Blockchain and by extension cryptocurrency technology have already had a profound impact on the world in many ways. For one early investor’s were very profitable from the success of popular cryptocurrencies including bitcoin as it has experienced exponential growth in price since its inception. Also, blockchain has a had a massive effect on governments around the world as they have been a topic of hot debate with many governments wanting to regulate cryptocurrencies which none have been able to successfully do yet, due to its decentralised nature instead governments are now starting too at the possible uses for blockchain technology due to its unprecedented security and anonymity. Any company that stores data securely will likely either be using or start using blockchain technology for the transmission of data as it is one of the most secure ways to transfer data from one device to another. Especially as cybercriminals become more and more malicious it will be a great security measure against them from intercepting data communications.
<br>
<br>
People in the IT industry will be largely affected as there will be many jobs created surrounding blockchain technology as it continues to be used by more and more companies. These jobs could include either being an app developer creating decentralized applications that live on the blockchain or developing a blockchain protocol themselves. We will also see more emphasis be placed on learning about blockchain technology at schools and higher education as it becomes more and more prevalent in society. Additionally, I believe that in the future these decentralised currencies will begin to stabilize and lose their volatility and as a result be more widely accepted as a method of payment at establishments internationally. This will result in less importance being placed on one’s own country's currency instead, this importance will be placed on using currency that is not controlled or regulated by anybody. Blockchain technology will also transform how artist distribute their work as they no longer will need to go through a distributor to release their work to a wide audience instead, they can use blockchain technology through NFTs for example. This will ensure that they are paid directly for their work but also are rewarded monetarily if a piece of artwork they sold balloons in value as opposed to traditional collecting where the artist is not seeing any of the profit when a piece of theirs begins to be auctioned off for very high prices. </p>
<br>
<br>
        <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
        <p>This emerging technology will provide new job opportunities for me to pursue in my future as there are a lot of career paths to go down, especially once the technology becomes more widespread. I think that in the future the way we have ownership of digital assets will be drastically different as blockchain lets users have unique ownership over what they buy through a sophisticated system. I think that we will find that when going to stores in the future we will see that they will begin to accept cryptocurrencies more commonly as a legitimate currency. “Blockchain will streamline” <sup><a href="references.html">[28]</a></sup> our lives allowing us to easily make transactions and easily view transaction history with very little effort involved. This will also reduce security concerns over sending or receiving money as only 2 parties are involved, no third party is needed to facilitate the transferal of goods as blockchain handles it.
